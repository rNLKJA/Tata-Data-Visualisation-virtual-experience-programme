- Ability to frame the data and visual mindset

**Hypothetical Business Context**

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. THe business has been performing well and the management wanst to analyse what the major contribution factors are the revenue so they can strategically plan for next.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what's working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evalute the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decisions on expansion.

**My Questions**
- Which country has the highest ROI? 
- What are the top 10 stocks? How about their profitability? 
- Who are our future, largest potential partners? 
- What are the top-selling products?

- Is there any preference for products we sell in a particular country when they buy our products? For example, are most of our French buyers looking into children's products? 
- Why do we have so many orders from the United Kingdom? 
- Why did we have fewer sales in Dec 2011 compared to Dec 2010? 
- Why did we experience a sell peak in November 2011? 

**Sample Solution**
- Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?
- What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
- Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?
- Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue?
- Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?

- What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?
- For the repeat customers, how long does it take them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?
- What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
- Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?

**Reflection**

It's important to think from the CEO/CMO position. Considering you are running your own company, figure out what the most important KPIs are to help you increase the company's profitability. Also, a good company should have a good retention rate, so as a data analyist, you should discover the consumer behaviors. How loyal customers help our business, how much money we make from them, and how to keep their interest so they can create more value for us.


## [Choosing the Right Visuals](https://www.theforage.com/modules/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX/W5Y8mMZr85DnBa8Es?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq)
Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario.

**Background information**

You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyse for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

You will be provided multiple visualisation requests by the CEO and you would need to provide the visual which would explain the data nad insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that you are trying to present. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. Therefore, you would need to make sure that the correct visuals are used to represent each of data.

**Task requirements**

In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. 
Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. 
Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.

You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in resources section. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. 
Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.

**Questions**
1. The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the entire year. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year. Which visual would most likely help the CEO analyse the data?

    Line chart. A line chart is used to represent repeated measurements taken over regular time intervals. Time always displayed on the horizontal axis and values on the vertical axis. The line chart would enable the CEO to see important changes in the data, like seasonality or cyclic behaviour, which will provide a better understanding of the revenue and help forecast better.
    
2. The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, as a subcomponent, they would also like to see which products are contributing to the total revenue being generated by each country. Which visual would enable the CMO to view the revenue for each country and the breakdown by products on a single chart?

    Stacked bar chart. A stakced bar chart would be used here as the chart allows users to compare subcomponent pieces across different cateogries. The height or length of the bars will represent the total revenue generated by each country. Each bar will be divided into the products sold, where the major portion will be allocated to the products that are generating more revenue. This will allow the CMO to view the total revenue data as well as the renuve for each individual product.
    
3. The CEO of the online retail store wants to see how much average revenue is generated by each country. They are interested in viewing the following metrics on the visual:
    - Mnimum value
    - First quartile value
    - Median value
    - Third quartile value
    - Maximum value
    
    Which char would you create to show the above metrics for the average revenue generated by each country?
    
    Boxplot. The CEO's request would best be fulfilled using a box plot. The box plot would show the distribution of data based on five number summary. Boxplots are used to graphically demonstrate the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data. Boxplots are used to graphically demonostrate the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data. By using the boxplot, we can easily spot outliers and the distribution of the plot.
    
4. The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. They are interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products. Which visuals would help the CMO understand the data on revenue generated by the top 10 customers.

    Column chart. The CMO's request would best be fulfilled by using a column chart. Column charts are used to display comparisons between different items. Alternatively, you can view a comparison of items over time. In this case, the column chart would display the top 10 customers who are contributing the most to revenue. The first bar on the left would be the longest one and would display information for the customer who bought the most goods from the online store. The revenue contributed by each customer would graduately decline as the bars move to the right.
    
5. The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. They want to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, they will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. Which chart would be most useful to provide the CEO information on the demand in each region?

    Map chart. A map chart would be the best option for visuals here as it will allow the CEO to view the demand information on a single view. The map chart will have all the countries on a single map and the demand will be displayed by highlighting the area of each country. Dark highlights would mean that the countries have high demand for products whereas the countries that are highlighted light colour are the ones that have low demand.  Geographical data is best visualised using map charts as they are very easy to view and the underlying values are also easy to analyse.

## [Creating Effective Visuals](https://www.theforage.com/modules/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX/ifGZCL6vAeE9mzxt3?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq)
Apply your under and create visuals based on business scenarios.

**Business Context**
The CEO and CMO have recently met to finalise the requirements and would like you to provide them with some analysis and visuals that would help answer their questions. Both, the executives are interested in viewing and understanding how they can use the data to make more meaningful decisions. You would need to provide insights which they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

You will be provided with the requirements of the executives and how they want to view the data. After the requirement gathering phase, you would need to make sure that the data you are using is of good quality and does not contain any bad data that would have an adverse impact on your analysis. Once the data is cleaned, the next step would be to create the visuals on either Tableau or Power BI. No matter which tool you choose for the visuals, the result should be the same. These results will help the executives with effective decision making and assist in their expansion strategy.

**Your job**

In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or PowerBI to create the visuals and we've provided the data in resources below.

**Data cleanup**

Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.
- Create a check that the quantity should not below 1 unit
- Create a check that the unit price not be below 0

Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, you would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from the analysis. You can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data. Both these methods are provided in the resources section. Once this is done, the data will be good to used for further analysis. Please note that this data should be cleaned up before attempting any question.

Create each visual on a separate tab with the name of the tab displaying the question number. Once the visuals are created, save the files and upload them below. For Tableau users, you would need to upload in `.twbx` format where as PowerBI files need to be saved in `.pbix` format.

**Questions**
- The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

- The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

- The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

- The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.
