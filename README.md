**My Questions**
- Which country has the highest ROI? 
- What are the top 10 stocks? How about their profitability? 
- Who are our future, largest potential partners? 
- What are the top-selling products?

- Is there any preference for products we sell in a particular country when they buy our products? For example, are most of our French buyers looking into children's products? 
- Why do we have so many orders from the United Kingdom? 
- Why did we have fewer sales in Dec 2011 compared to Dec 2010? 
- Why did we experience a sell peak in November 2011? 

**Sample Solution**
- Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?
- What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
- Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?
- Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue?
- Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?

- What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?
- For the repeat customers, how long does it take them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?
- What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?
- Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?

**Reflection**

It's important to think from the CEO/CMO position. Considering you are running your own company, figure out what the most important KPIs are to help you increase the company's profitability. Also, a good company should have a good retention rate, so as a data analyist, you should discover the consumer behaviors. How loyal customers help our business, how much money we make from them, and how to keep their interest so they can create more value for us.


## [Choosing the Right Visuals](https://www.theforage.com/modules/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX/W5Y8mMZr85DnBa8Es?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq)
Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario.

**Background information**

You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyse for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

You will be provided multiple visualisation requests by the CEO and you would need to provide the visual which would explain the data nad insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that you are trying to present. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. Therefore, you would need to make sure that the correct visuals are used to represent each of data.

**Task requirements**

In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. 
Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. 
Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.

You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in resources section. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. 
Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.
